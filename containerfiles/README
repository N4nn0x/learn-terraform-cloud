To modify the HTML we recreate the image and upload it to the repo

1) Modify your HTML file as needed on your local machine.

2) Build a new Docker image with the updated HTML file using your existing Dockerfile. 
sudo docker build -t docker_image:lab .

3) Tag it
sudo docker tag docker_image:lab nanogk/docker_image:lab

4) Upload to private repo
sudo docker push nanogk/docker_image:lab
